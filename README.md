First Repository, learning experience for GitHub

Hello, my name is Justin.

I love life. There are so many incredible things out there to experience, and I cannot wait to dive in even further. 
GitHub and programming are getting so exciting and are really beginning to become a part of my life in a way that I can't explain how much I appreciate. 
I love the way of thinking and working through problems, and I love being able to create beautiful incredible things.
